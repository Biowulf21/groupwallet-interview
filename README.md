# Little exercise

Hello, this is an interview exercise for GroupWallet. 

This is a simple Flutter application that stores groups and their balances. 

The app contains: 
1. Groups page (where users could add new groups)
2. Group details page (where users could update group's balance)

### Task

The task is pretty simple: you have to update app to add "history" functionality. 

1. Store info when user creates expenses or incomes (I have prepared `Transactions` database table for you)
2. Display this data somewhere (your decision will it be a new page or you will display it inside group details page)
3. User should be able to edit amount for existed `transaction` (either from another page or by displaying dialog or whatever you decide, the main thing is that amount of transaction should be updated)

* Notice that group's balance should be equal to sum of all transactions
* Feel free to update/change existing code if you need/want to
* UI is not important for this task
